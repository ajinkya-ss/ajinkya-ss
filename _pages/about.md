Welcome! I am **Ajinkya Shingote**, a Ph.D. student in **Chemistry** at the [Department of Chemistry ](https://acms.nd.edu/), **University of Notre Dame**, IN, USA.

I am a first-year doctoral student specializing in Physical Chemistry, currently conducting research under the guidance 
of Professor Gregory Hartland. My work focuses on strong excitonâ€“plasmon coupling in metalâ€“semiconductor hybrid 
structures. Broadly, I am interested in materials chemistry, with a particular passion for designing materials for 
energy-related applications.

Previously, I completed my **BS-MS. in Chemistry** at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), Pune, India, where I worked on my masterâ€™s project under the guidance of [Dr.  Anshuman Nag](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/faculty/).
